## Data Structure  
This repository is only coded for know data structure more. If there is something wrong, please let me know when you find it.
### Features  
- variadic templates  
  This means that you can throw many types of elements without overload.  
- memory reading and write  
  This means.... All right, idk, but I must do this.


### Usage  
- DO NOT USE `LinkNode<Args...>` AS YOU CAN!  
  IT IS A BAISC CLASS FOR THIS DATA STRUCTURE REALIZATION!  
  Its arg `size` should be correctly input.  
  So, it is easy to get in trouble.  
- DO NOT PUT EACH KINDS OF CLASS THAT WILL MANAGE ITS MEMORY DYNAMICLY.
